# Embedding Images in HTML

## Introduction

In this section, we'll explore the concept of embedding images in HTML using the `img` tag and its attributes.

## The `img` Tag

The `img` tag is used to embed images in an HTML document. It's a self-closing tag, meaning it doesn't require a closing tag.

- **Basic Syntax:**

           <img src="image_url" alt="image_description"title="image_title">
### Attributes

The `img` tag has several attributes that provide additional information about the image:

* `src`: specifies the URL of the image file.
* `alt`: provides a text description of the image for accessibility purposes and for display when the image cannot be loaded.
* `title`: provides a tooltip or a brief description of the image when the user hovers over it.

### Image Formats

There are several image formats that can be used on the web, each with its own strengths and weaknesses:

* JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group)
* PNG (Portable Network Graphics)
* GIF (Graphics Interchange Format)
* SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)

### Best Practices

Here are some best practices to keep in mind when working with images in HTML:

* Use descriptive file names
* Optimize image size
* Use alt text
* Use title text

### Examples

Here are a few examples of using the `img` tag with different attributes:

* Basic Image

          <img src="image.jpg" alt="A beautifullandscape">

* Image with Title

          <img src="image.jpg" alt="A beautiful leaf" title="A beautiful leaf in  the night">

* Image with Link

           <a href="https://www.example.com">
          <img src="image1.jpg" alt="A beautiful landscape" title="A beautiful landscape in the mountains">
           </a>
